Welcome to my webpage! My name is Atanas Dinev and I am fourth-year Ph.D. student at the [Operations Research Center](https://orc.mit.edu) at [MIT](https://www.mit.edu) where I am advised by [Prof. Thodoris Lykouris](https://mitmgmtfaculty.mit.edu/tlykouris/). 

My research interests broadly lie in sequential decision-making, machine learning, online algorithms, game theory and their applications to online marketplaces and platforms. I am also generally interested in applied probability and revenue management. 

Prior to joining MIT, I graduated magna cum laude from [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu) with Bachelor's degree in Mathematics. While at Princeton, I worked with [Prof. Matt Weinberg](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~smattw/) on projects in Algorithmic Game Theory and Algorithms Under Uncertainty. 

Beyond research, I enjoy playing table tennis, pick-up basketball games, and going for outdoor runs.
